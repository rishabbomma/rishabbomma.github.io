                I'll put great insights right below, but then have a free-flowing diary below.

                    This is the view I have, but I would like to expound on it. I want more students and young people to
                    have better (and more optimistic) policy views and attitudes. A lot people within the organization
                    (namely, Victoria) think otherwise and want more mass-movement vibes, but I think a suitable
                    combination of the two can be created.

                    <br><br> I can't find the tweet now, but the poster made the
                    distintcion between "diagnosis" and "policy".
                    Lots of diagnoses of American's current qualms feel very appealing from the populist side e.g. young
                    people not being able to buy a home, but a lot of policy prescriptions that are much more elite e.g. upzoning. ƒ
