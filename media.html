                  Dr. Ludwig Guttmann was a German Jew who escaped Nazi Germany in 1939 and found a job in a hospital
                  in Britain that served paraplegics, mostly men injured in the war. When he first started working
                  there, the hospital heavily sedated these men and kept them confined to their beds. Guttmann,
                  however, didn’t see the patients the way the other doctors saw them. He cut back on the sedatives,
                  forced them out of bed, and started throwing balls at them and doing other things to get them
                  active.
                  <br /><br />
                  As a result, he was summoned to a tribunal of his peers, where his methods were challenged.
                  <br /><br />
                  “These are moribund cripples,” one doctor asserted.
                  <br /><br />
                  “They are the best of men,” Guttmann replied.

                <time> Dec 6, 2025 </time>
              </h2>

              <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Spring_Harbor_Laboratory"> Cold Spring Harbor
                  Laboratory
                </a> created an obituary for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watson"> James Watson</a> who
                died a month ago (November
                5th). I’ve never heard of CSHL before, but apparently they’re a big deal.

                Anyway, Pachter just dunks on Watson with his comments (in red) and here are some excerpts of his
                commentary.</p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p> Watson, along with Crick and Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
                  Watson also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Gerald Ford and the National
                  Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton, among many other awards and prizes.</p>
                <p style="color: red"> It is true that Watson received these awards. Coincidentally, William Shockley
                  was also awarded the Nobel Prize around the same time as Watson (physics, 1956) and he promoted racist
                  eugenics, arguing that people of African Ancestry posed a “dysgenic risk”, as well as advocating for
                  sterilization. He used his Nobel prestige to advance his malicious and scientifically bankrupt ideas
                  (source: Scott Rosenberg, 2017)</p>

              </div>

              <p> He portrays Watson as not as intelligent as his awards make him out to be, a dick, and a race realist.
                Ronald Fischer was sort of a race realist and a dick, but a genius within statistics. Watson, from my
                limited understanding of him, seems to be like Ronald Fischer, but just worse in every way. He also just
                seemed to be particularly petty especially against other women within biology e.g Rosalind Franklin.
              </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p>As an author, Watson wrote two books at Harvard that were and remain best sellers. The textbook
                  Molecular Biology of the Gene, published in 1965 (7th edition, 2020), changed the nature of science
                  textbooks, and its style was widely emulated. </p>
                <p style="color: red"> In this textbook Watson got the central dogma wrong, presenting it in a
                  profoundly misleading way. (source: Matthew Cobb, 2024).</p>
              </div>
              The <a href="https://www.asimov.press/p/crick"> article Pachter cites </a> is really well written! Reading
              it was fun and I learned a little bit of biology
              that might just stick. Anyway, Cobb states that Watson misinterpreted Crick’s idea (“the central dogma”).
              That original idea was that the usual chain one sees in biology, DNA -> RNA -> Proteins, can’t be observed
              strictly in reverse. However, Crick doesn’t discard the fact that, for example, DNA can’t be replicated
              from RNA. Indeed, this was in fact shown in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/2261198a0">
                lab</a>.
              <div class="quote-block">
                <p> But on pages 1209 and 1211 of this issue of Nature, Baltimore and Mizutani and Temin claim
                  independently that RNA tumour viruses contain an enzyme which uses the viral RNA as a template for the
                  synthesis of DNA and thus reverses the direction of genetic transcription.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p> Now, I’m not too sure of Pachterß's point. I can’t find a copy of the original 1965 book since later
                editions have presumably been updated accordingly. However, I did easily find a copy of the seventh
                edition, which ßcontains theß following sentence on page 41. </p>
              <div class="quote-block">
                As we have seen, according to the “central dogma” information flows from DNA to
                RNA to protein.
              </div>

              <p> This sentence is out of context since this is what was written on page 33. </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p> In 1956 Francis Crick referred to this pathway for the flow of genetic information as the central
                  dogma: </p>
                <img src="./pics/mollecular_bio_diagram.png" alt="" width="700" height="100" />
                <p> The arrow between DNA and RNA indicates that RNA synthesis (called transcription) is directed by a
                  DNA template. Corre- spondingly, the synthesis of proteins (called translation) is directed by an RNA
                  template. Most importantly, the last two arrows were presented as uni- directional; that is, RNA
                  sequences are never determined by protein tem- plates nor was DNA then imagined ever to be made on RNA
                  templates.

                  <br><br>

                  However, as we will see in Chapter 12, RNA chains sometimes do act as templates for DNA chains of
                  complementary sequence. Such reversals of the normal flow of information are very rare events compared
                  with the enormous number of RNA molecules made on DNA templates.
                </p>
              </div>


              <p> I think the authors of the seventh edition essentially pulled that diagram from <a
                  href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/xmscu3g4/items"> Crick’s original
                  thought process </a> (found through Cobb’s article), which is pretty interesting.

                <img style="float:auto" src="./pics/crick_central_dogma.png" alt="" width="600" height="500" />
              </p>

              <p> From everything I’ve read so far, it seems like a lot of people misinterpreted what Crick’s intentions
                were, so I don’t think this is that big of a deal. It seems like the book has had a net-positive impact
                on people and especially due to all of the lovely people who continually created newer and better
                editions of it.
              </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p> The Double Helix (1968) was a sensation at the time of publication. Watson’s
                  account of the events that resulted in the elucidation of the structure of DNA remains controversial,
                  but still widely read.</p>

                <p style="color:red"> Prior to the publication of The Double Helix, Francis Crick wrote that “If you
                  publish your book now, in
                  the teeth of my opposition, history will condemn you”. Watson published the book anyway (source:
                  letter
                  by Francis Crick, 1967) .</p>


              </div>

              <p> This is another point, which, on the surface, seems like a straightforward dunk, but actually has a
                much more interesting story. The point Pachter is implicitly making is completely true: Watson’s
                account of the discovery of the structure of DNA in the original 1968 autobiography and Crick very
                much condemned him at the time. The Double Helix is quite inaccurate and is a very personal account of
                every event and of other people’s involvement.

                <br><br>

                The canonical example everyone refers to is Rosalind Franklin who is consistently referred to as
                <a href="https://dnalc.cshl.edu/view/15692-Rosalind-Franklin.html"> “Rosy” </a>. There were tensions
                between her and Maurice Wilkins (another person who shared the Nobel with
                Watson & Crick), but Watson describes Rosalind as being too assertive as a woman and blames her lack
                of femininity for the issues between her and Wilkins.

                <br><br>

                The following excerpt is from page 13 of Gunther Sten’s 1980 Norton Critical Edition of The Double
                Helix, which, alongside the original book, contains a lot of material that contrasts with Watson’s
                view.
              </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                I suspect that in the beginning Maurice hoped that Rosy would calm down. Yet mere inspection suggested
                that she would not easily bend. By choice she did not emphasize her feminine qualities. Though her
                features were strong, she was not unattractive and might have been quite stunning had she taken even a
                mild interest in clothes.

                <br><br>

                [...]

                <br><br>

                There was never lipstick to contrast with her straight black hair, while at the age of thirty-one her
                dresses showed all the imagination of English blue-stocking adolescents.

                <br><br>

                So it was quite easy to imagine her the product of an unsatisfied mother who unduly stressed the
                desirability of professional careers that could save bright girls from marriages to dull men. But this
                was not the case.

              </div>

              To end this off, here’s another Pachter post about things Watson has said. In particular:
              <br> <br>
              <div class="quote-block">
                “[Rosalind Franklin] was a loser”
              </div>

              I was going to read more about Ronald Fischer’s life since I have a strong feeling that there’s something
              to learn from comparing him and Watson, but I’ll save that for another day.

                Here’s a problem that Berkeleyside wrestles with frequently. Should we refer to residents of Berkeley as
                Berkeleyites or Berkeleyans?

                To my ear, Berkeleyites sounds better. It gets 25,000 results on Google. Someone has entered it into the
                City Dictionary. Berkeleyan, on the other hand, gets 110,000 Google hits. Looks like a done deal,
                doesn’t it? But hang on. A lot of those Berkeleyan hits are because it’s the accepted adjective for
                things relating to Bishop Berkeley (photo left) or his system of philosophical idealism.

                Tell us readers. What do you think? Of course, we could cut the Gordian knot and just agree to call
                everyone Berkeleysiders.

              </div>

              I think Berkeleyan makes the most sense here since due to Bishop Berkeley’s idea of <a
                href="https://academic.oup.com/book/2713/chapter-abstract/143184609?redirectedFrom=fulltext"> Berkeleyan
                Idealism</a>,
              Another spelling seems to be with an “i” and thus <a
                href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Berkeleian"> Berkelian </a>, which feels a bit cooler.
              I get the same
              vibes from “Bayesian” as “Berkelyan”.

              <br><br>

              Oddly enough, Urban Dictionary only has a record from 2011 of Berkeleyite (Berkeleyside article was
              published April 2011). “Berkelyite” is pretty lame, but “Berkelite” looks/sounds a bit better.

                The biggest shift I felt right away was the sudden, exponential spike in imposter syndrome. UW did
                something clever during orientation for the first-year PhD cohort: the very first slide they showed
                simply read “YOU BELONG HERE.” All caps.
              </div>

              Shachar Kariv (economist at Berkeley), during the first lecture of his economic theory class, constantly
              reminded the graduate students of this fact. I internally scoffed (since I was/am a “smart”
              undergraduate) at first, and all the other times he would find little ways to remind his audience they
              were enough.

              <br />
              <br />

              Anyway, right before our midterm and right after, he emphasized this to each and every person in that
              class and I’m glad he did. I didn’t score as well as I had wanted (earned a B), but his reassurance that
              we all deserved to be there did put a smile on my face when we received our grades for that midterm a
              week later.
              <br /><br />
              <div class="quote-block">
                What struck me was how my mind reacted to all of this. You’d think I would remind myself, “Hey, I
                started a PhD with twelve publications, which is a wild number for an undergrad.” But no. Instead, the
                thought that greeted me on day one was:

                <br /><br />

                “Alright. You’ve managed to weasel your way through so far. Now’s the moment they finally uncover that
                you’re a fraud.”

              Taking extreme pride in all of your work is almost the definition of hubris. Taking too little is a
              toxic humility.

                The point is this: I don’t think anyone is fully aware of the complexity of who they are until they’re
                pushed to face themselves. A high-pressure environment forces those parts to the surface — all of them
                — and you finally see what’s been hiding underneath.

              <p>
                This article is from the International Center for Law & Economics and I don't really pay attention to
                antitrust stuff, but this article seemed pretty interesting. The subject of the article is the
                European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA, 2023), which forces "gatekeepers"-think Apple and Google-to
                allow for alternative in-app payment processing and app stores on their mobile operating systems.
                Here's an
                <a
                  href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/move-over-apple-meet-the-alternative-app-stores-coming-to-the-eu/">
                  article
                </a>
                with some examples of alternative app stores that are allowed in the EU <br /><br />
              </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p class="source">
                  Source: Brian Albrecht (Chief Economist) & Dirk Auer (Director of Competition Policy)
                </p>
                The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and similar regulations around the world require designated
                “gatekeepers” to open their mobile operating systems to third-party app stores and sideloading. They
                also typically include requirements that developers be allowed to use alternative in-app payment
                systems and to “steer” users toward purchases outside the app store.
              </div>

              The thesis of the article is that one can't maximize both competition among third-party app stores and
              payment processors. Since all of these app stores would have to draw their revenue from somewhere and
              would be forced to follow Apple's example of charging a commission on in-app sales and banning apps that
              didn't comply. A good example of this is Apple banning
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1knw4jq/fortnite_removed_from_app_store_entirely_after/">
                Fortnite
              </a>
              for bypassing their 30% commission on in-app purchases. <br /><br />
              Now, if one forces app stores to allow developers to contract alternative payment processors (think
              PayPal or Venmo) then developers would be able to keep more of their revenue and free ride off of the
              investments of all of those alternative app stores. Additionally, these alternative app stores would
              themselves be relying on OS-level infrastructure (discovery, security, etc.) and be free riding off of
              Apple's investments. This would lead to underinvestment in what makes the Apple app store work
              reasonably well in the first place e.g fraud protection, curation, advertising, etc.
              <br /><br />

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p class="source">

                </p>
                Alternative payments and steering compound the problem. Developers can use the store’s discovery and
                curation infrastructure to acquire users, then route purchases through lower-cost payment channels.
                The store still bears the cost of matching users and developers but loses the revenue that justified
                that investment.
              </div>

              Or, it would lead to Apple increasing costs for developers!

                Developers operating under the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU have the option to
                distribute their iOS and iPadOS apps in the EU via the App Store, Web Distribution, and/or alternative
                app marketplaces. They can also use alternative payment processors in their apps in the EU on the App
                Store across Apple operating systems. The CTF only applies to apps downloaded by EU users on devices
                running minimum of iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 18.

                annual install over one million in the past 12 months.
              </div>
              I feel convinced that the DMA doesn't make too much sense, since it really just makes it harder for
              companies to provide/maintain the infrastructure needed for app developers to flourish.

                Not completely sure where I found out about this article. It probably was from Marginal Revolution.
                Regardless, here's an excerpt that gave me a bit more insight on the art of game theoretic modeling.
              </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p class="source">Source: Journal of Economic Literature, Roger Myerson</p>
                One of the triumphs of Fearon’s approach is his demonstration that a preventive war by a currently
                dominant nation against a rising nation, such as Germany contemplated against Russia in 1914, can be
                understood in terms of moral-hazard commitment problems in a dynamic game.
                <br />
                <br />
                [...] <br />
                <br />
                The key to this analysis is that the rising nation cannot credibly commit itself now to refrain from
                using its ability to threaten war in the future after power has shifted in its favor, but the
                currently dominant nation could prevent this shift of power by launching a costly war now.
                <br /><br />
              </div>
              If I'm being honest, this doesn't offer too much insight into the Great war as it is by itself. The
              excerpt is just a good example of game theory and its language being used to convey one plausible
              explanation for conflict. Myerson does of course mention this a bit later.

                As Wolford rightly argues, we can gain important insights into the problems of war when we try to
                explain leaders’ choices as rational decisions in terms of natural human values. But what would happen
                if we tried to rationalize a surprising decision that was actually a mistake? The surprising move
                could be rationalized in a Bayesian game by hypothesizing that the decision maker has an unusual type
                with preferences or beliefs that would induce such behavior
                <br />
                <br />
                [...]
                <br /><br />
                Thus, Germany’s surprising invasion of Belgium in 1914 could cause people in Britain to infer that
                Germany had aggressive expansionist leadership, while people in Germany might consider such beliefs to
                be unjustified British prejudice.
              </div>
              I'm not super sure, but the issue of decision-making under a misspecified model is, at least
              theoretically, explored in the paper
