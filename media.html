              <p> Enjoying the book so far. I really enjoyed the third chapter, so here's an insightful excerpt from it.  </p>

                <p class="note"> 
                  Dr. Ludwig Guttmann was a German Jew who escaped Nazi Germany in 1939 and found a job 
                  in a hospital in Britain that served paraplegics, mostly men injured in the war. 
                  When he first started working there, 
                  the hospital heavily sedated these men and kept them confined to their beds. Guttmann, 
                  however, didn’t see the patients the way the other doctors saw them.
                  He cut back on the sedatives, forced them out of bed, 
                  and started throwing balls at them and doing other things to get them active. 
                  <br><br>
                  As a result, he was summoned to a tribunal of his peers, where his methods were challenged.
                  <br><br>
                  “These are moribund cripples,” one doctor asserted. “Who do you think they are?”
                  <br><br> “They are the best of men,” Guttmann replied.  </p>

            <p> This person's website is pretty interesting. I found out about it from this <a href = "https://ratorthodox.substack.com/p/branguss-10-rules-for-sleeping-with" > article about sex</a>. 
              Her <a href = "https://x.com/dundereloise"> twitter account</a>  is linked in the third footnote. Below are some excerpts from the writing section that I thought were cool.  </p>

              When walking outside I sometimes get a sense of appreciation for how paradise-like my surroundings are.
              <br><br>
              I walk to the park near my home. A park! How absurdly utopian it is that 
              we’ve fenced off an area that’s sole purpose is just to be nice.  
              In the park there are pigeons waddling around fat on French fries, because food 
              is so abundant that people are sometimes careless with it. 
              (And French fries exist! Transcendent deliciousness beyond a cave man’s wildest dreams.)

              If I were a billionaire I would hire someone well-acquainted with my tastes whose job it is 
              to print out tweets I'd enjoy and hand them to me on paper, 
              <br> so I can't see bad comments and can't get sucked into browsing twitter.

            <p> This article was pretty interesting. I don't follow football (certainly not college football), but how our (Cal's) team changes  
              <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1p537tn/cal_fires_coach_justin_wilcox_after_lopsided_loss/"> after the devestating loss at the big game </a> is sure to be interesting.
              Putting that aside, this quote is pretty funny without sufficient context. </p>

              “I think that’s very much the ethos now: Everybody has to do their part to save Cal football,” Kranz said. 
              “We have to turn to communism to save Cal football, not out of ideology, but out of desperation. 
              A lot of this effort is about trying to preserve something that is a unifying sense of community
               for the campus when we don’t have a ton of those things here.”
