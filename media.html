                <p class="note"> 
                  Dr. Ludwig Guttmann was a German Jew who escaped Nazi Germany in 1939 and found a job 
                  in a hospital in Britain that served paraplegics, mostly men injured in the war. 
                  When he first started working there, 
                  the hospital heavily sedated these men and kept them confined to their beds. Guttmann, 
                  however, didn’t see the patients the way the other doctors saw them.
                  He cut back on the sedatives, forced them out of bed, 
                  and started throwing balls at them and doing other things to get them active. 
                  <br><br>
                  As a result, he was summoned to a tribunal of his peers, where his methods were challenged.
                  <br><br>
                  “These are moribund cripples,” one doctor asserted. “Who do you think they are?”
                  <br><br> “They are the best of men,” Guttmann replied.  </p>

            <time>Dec 2, 2025</time>

           
            <p> This article is from the International Center for Law & Economics and
               I don't really pay attention to antitrust stuff, but this article seemed pretty interested. 
              The subject of the article is the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA, 2023), 
              which forces "gatekeepers"-think of Apple and Google which don't allow for apps to be installed anywhere else except 
              their own app stores-to allow for alternative in-app payment processing and alternative app stores. 
            <br><br>
          
          </p>
            
            <div class="feed-entry">
              <p class="source">Source: Brian Albrecht (Chief Economist) & Dirk Auer (Director of Competition Policy) </p>
              The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and similar regulations around the world require designated “gatekeepers” to open 
              their mobile operating systems to third-party app stores and sideloading. 
              They also typically include requirements that developers be allowed to use alternative in-app payment systems 
              and to “steer” users toward purchases outside the app store.
             
               
            </div>

            The thesis of the article is that the DMA assumes that commissions that any platform (think Apple or Google) 
            aren't necessarily fair for deveolpers if they don't exactly have a choice of app store to platform their app or in-app payment processing. 
            For the latter, they might be able to create or find a cheaper alternative to Apple/Google's in-house payment processing for in-app purchases.
            Additionally, Albrecht and Auer claim that it would be hard to induce greater choice for alternative app stores AND payment processing systems at the same time. 
            
            <br><br> 
            
            Regardless of who's in the market, there's a pervasive free riding problem since any platform that would spawn due to the DMA would have to charge 
            commissions for each deveolper wanting to use their infrastructure, audience, and anti-fraud software/OS.
            However, since the DMA requires that these app stores allow deveolpers to "steer" consumers off the platform e.g using Stripe as a payment processor, 
            then this new hypothetical app store would have the same issue of other free riding.
            
            <br><br>

            <div class="feed-entry">
              <p class="source">Source: Brian Albrecht (Chief Economist) & Dirk Auer (Director of Competition Policy) </p>
              Alternative payments and steering compound the problem. 
              Developers can use the store’s discovery and curation infrastructure to acquire users, then route purchases through lower-cost payment channels. 
              The store still bears the cost of matching users and developers but loses the revenue that justified that investment.

            </div>

            To finish this write-up, here's an <a href = "https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/move-over-apple-meet-the-alternative-app-stores-coming-to-the-eu/">  article </a> with some examples of alternative app stores.
            The most well-known is probably Epic Games that was <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1knw4jq/fortnite_removed_from_app_store_entirely_after/" > removed from the App store </a> 
            for bypassing Apple's payment processing system that charges a 30% commission. 
            <br> <br> 
            Personally, I feel a bit unconvinced in that I wouldn't feel confident arguing with others about the efficacy of this sort of antitrust policy.
            I'm sure that the status quo involved a lot of good exchanges and Apple/Google most definetely provided value to deveolpers and consumers. 
            But I can't think of any policies that would manage the trade-offs discussed above in a strictly better way than the status quo.
            The Digital Markets Act might be more sophisticated than the article implies, but I'm not too sure what the actual effect of it. 
            
            <br> <br> 

            To emphasize that last point, according to the article, Apple is also introducing a new fee to account for the free riding problem the article masterfully points out.

              Developers operating under the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU have the option to
               distribute their iOS and iPadOS apps 
              in the EU via the App Store, Web Distribution, and/or alternative app marketplaces. 
              They can also use alternative payment processors in their apps in the EU on the App Store
               across Apple operating systems. The CTF only applies to apps downloaded by EU users on devices
                running minimum of iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 18.

            <time>Dec 2, 2025</time>
            <p> Not completely sure where I found out about this article. It probably was from Marginal Revolution. 
              Regardless, here's an excerpt that gave me a bit more insight on the art of game theoretic modeling.   </p>
            
            <div class="feed-entry">
              <p class="source">Source: Journal of Economic Literature, Roger Myerson </p>
              One of the triumphs of Fearon’s approach is his demonstration that a preventive war
              by a currently dominant nation against a rising nation, such as Germany contemplated
            against Russia in 1914, can be understood in
            terms of moral-hazard commitment problems in a dynamic game. <br> <br> [...] <br> <br> 
            The key to this analysis is that the rising nation 
            cannot credibly commit itself now to refrain from using its ability to threaten war in the future 
            after power has shifted in its favor, but the 
            currently dominant nation could prevent this shift of power by launching a costly war now. 
              <br><br>
            </div>
            If I'm being honest, this doesn't offer too much insight into the Great war as it is by itself. 
            The excerpt is just a good example of game theory and its language being used to convey one plausible explanation for conflict. 
            Myerson does of course mention this is a bit later. 

            <div class="feed-entry">
              <p class="source">Source: Journal of Economic Literature, Roger Myerson </p>
              As Wolford rightly argues, we can gain important insights into the problems of war 
              when we try to explain leaders’ choices as rational decisions in terms of natural human values. 
              But what would happen if we tried to rationalize a surprising decision that was actually a mistake? 
              The surprising move could be rationalized in a Bayesian game by hypothesizing that 
              the decision maker has an unusual type with preferences or beliefs that would induce such behavior
              <br> <br>
              [...]
              <br><br>
              Thus, Germany’s surprising invasion of Belgium in 1914 could cause people in Britain to infer that Germany had 
              aggressive expansionist leadership, while people in Germany might consider such beliefs to be unjustified British prejudice. 
            </div>
            I'm not super sure, but the issue of decision-making under a misspecified model is, at least theoretically, 
            explored in the paper <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wopk4Kp6NzVaCAQ7TxL7mb88XkJBqShY/view"  > Making Decisions under Model Misspecification </a>.

              I walk to the park near my home. A park! How absurdly utopian it is that

              In the park there are pigeons waddling around fat on French fries, because food 
              is so abundant that people are sometimes careless with it. 
              (And French fries exist! Transcendent deliciousness beyond a cave man’s wildest dreams.)
