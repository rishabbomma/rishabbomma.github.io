              <time> Dec 28, 2025</time>
              I completely forgot about this. I recall intensely following the court cases surrounding Jan 6th in
              2023-2024, combing through hundreds of pages of legal documents and articles to get a better sense of what
              happened, and even reading through Jack Smith’s final special counsel report. In retrospect, it was
              probably a waste of time, but here we are again: reading up on criminal acts related to Jan 6th.

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block">
                Before the arrest of Mr. Cole, the pipe bomb case had bedeviled the F.B.I. for years as agents chased a
                panoply of suspects and false leads. Investigators were finally able to crack the case after a bureau
                technician successfully gained access to cellphone data that implicated Mr. Cole and was previously
                thought to be corrupted.

                <br><br>

                Once he confessed to planting the bombs, the court papers said, Mr. Cole explained to investigators how
                he did it. According to the papers, he said that he had made the explosive powder in the devices using
                “charcoal, Lilly Miller sulfur dust and potassium nitrate that he purchased from Lowe’s.”

              </div>

              Literal Heisenberg shit. From Lowe’s?
              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block">
                He mixed these ingredients in a Pyrex bowl, the papers said, and used “a spoon or measuring cup” to pour
                the powder into the bombs. Mr. Cole told the F.B.I. that he had learned to make the powder from a video
                game that listed the ingredients and had also “viewed various science-related videos on YouTube to
                assist him.”
              </div>

              Here is the <a
                href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.287328/gov.uscourts.dcd.287328.17.0.pdf">
                legal document</a>
              , which contains all of the details of Brian Cole’s arrest and crimes.

              <br><br>

              Below are two pictures of the two IEDs, which I just now learned was short-hand for "improvised explosive
              device”. I didn’t read through the entire document, but the perpetrator definitely acted alone and
              everything was done in an incredibly DIY way.

                We're more than a quarter way through the new century and we can now ask: what is the aesthetic of the
                twenty-first century? Which are the important secessionist movements of today? Which will be the most
                important great works? Today, futuristic aesthetics often mean retrofuturistic aesthetics. So, what
                should the future actually look like?

                <br><br>

                There will not be singular answers to these, but we are very interested in attempts to answer the
                questions. In particular, we would like to fund some artists who are thinking about them.


                <br><br>
                Grant size: $5k – $250k.
                Deadline: Applications are open until March 31, 2026.

              </div>


              This will be pretty interesting. I’m definitely not interested in receiving a grant, but, hopefully, a lot
              of other artists will and I’ll become more cognizant of their work.

                Grief, you don’t need me to tell you, is a complicated beast. You can grieve for something even when you
                know that, on balance, it’s good that it’s gone. The death of these dialects, of the stories told on
                summer nights in the mountains with the cows, is a loss reasonably grieved. But you don’t hear the kids
                wishing more people would be forced to stay or speak this funny-sounding tongue.

                <br><br>

                You don’t even hear the old folks wishing they could go back fifty years—in those days it wasn’t so easy
                to be sure of a meal. For many, it’s better this way, not the best it could be, but still better, even
                as they grieve what they stand to lose and what they’ve already lost.

                <br><br>

                The grief I feel, imagining a world without needed work, seems closest to this kind of loss. A future
                without work could be much better than ours, overall. But, living in that world, or watching as our old
                ways passed away, we might still reasonably grieve the loss of the work that once was part of who we
                were.

              </h2>
              <time>Dec 25, 2025</time>

              I’m pulling an all-nighter the morning of Christmas. It is currently 12:50 am. I’m just going to dump
              things
              I’ve read that are Christmas related. Or, on second thought, anything I read is fair game.

              <br><br>

              Okay, I went to sleep at 4 am. This will now contain all of the articles I choose to write about on
              Christmas day.

              <h2> <a href="https://repository.law.umich.edu/other/227/"> Court cases settled on Christmas day </a></h2>

              <div class="quote-block"> The point is that everyone knows that there are thousands upon thousands of
                cases
                about Christmas but, to date, no one has taken it upon himself to study the cases decided on Christmas
                Day. Why, you ask? Never mind that. Because no one has done it, it’s something to be done. And now I
                have.
                Yes indeed. I have meticulously catalogued every single published judicial decision in American history
                rendered on December 25. In this pathbreaking article, I provide an empirical assessment, both
                quantitative and qualitative, of those cases.
              </div>

              Published in 2021,, <a
                href="https://michigan.law.umich.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/our-faculty/daniel-crane"> Professor
                Crane</a> (at the University of Michigan) documented 107 court cases where a
              decision was made on Christmas day: 14 from a federal court and 93 from a state court. Weirdly enough, 62%
              of the state ones come from Connecticut! Even weirder, there were no rulings on Christmas day from any
              court from 1891 to 1986!

              <br><br>

              Here’s an excerpt from this article detailing some of the content of these cases.

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block"> Consider a Connecticut Supreme Court decision rendered on December 25, 2012,
                holding that just because someone is a joint account holder doesn’t mean that they’re incapable of
                embezzling from the account.

                <br><br>

                Surely only Ebenezer Scrooge could rule that it’s theft to take one’s own money. Or ruling that a
                construction project for a donut shop was an impermissible expansion of a preexisting nonconforming use.
                Taking away donuts on Christmas. Really?!

                <br><br>

                And only someone with a heart two sizes too small could have authored Zirinsky v. Carnegie Hill Capital
                Asset Management ordering the removal of children’s playground equipment as exceeding an easement. Did
                you hear what I heard? Ordering a playground removed on Christmas. You’re a mean one, Mr. Grinch!

              This is a story written by John Cheever and published on December 17 by the New Yorker. It’s a pretty cute
              story, but I found myself being annoyed by my really stupid habit of skipping over paragraphs, with the
              half-hearted intent to “reread them”, since I think I understand the gist of them. It’s a story, read all
              of
              it!

              <br>

              Before I get into the new things I learned, I just have to say that I hate national security briefs. Half
              of
              the text in any brief isn’t necessary and it never contains any quantitative information beyond counts of
              stuff like the graph above. I understand there are clear data limitations and that the authors of these
              briefs aren’t data scientists. But c’mon, I want cool arguments that <a
                href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Dark_Shipping.pdf"> leverage satellite data </a> to make
              quantitative claims about the amount of harm caused by particular state acts.

              <br><br>

              Anyway, first off, I learned about some more Russian assassinations throughout the war. <a
                href="https://www.reuters.com/world/spanish-court-closes-probe-into-russian-defectors-murder-lack-suspects-2025-12-09/">In
                Spain </a>, a Russian
              pilot by the name of Maxim Kuzminov was found dead in February of 2024. He apparently defected to Ukraine
              in
              2023.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/us-germany-foiled-russian-assassination-plot">In
                Germany </a>, the CEO of Rheinmetall, the largest German manufacturer of artillery shells, was targeted
              by Russia (obviously) last year in July of 2024. I feel sort of stupid for not remembering this, but I
              will
              now for the rest of time!

              <br><br>

              To wrap this up (I didn’t particularly enjoy this article), I think I’ll pay a bit more attention to
              Russian
              sabotage events. I never really paid attention in the past since it’s mostly blah blah blah infrastructure
              yada yada underwater fiber optic cables: super abstract stuff (half-joking when I say this).
              <br><br>
              But this excerpt did stand out to me.

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block"> Russian sabotage operations in Europe have accelerated, increasing in both the
                frequency and boldness of physical attacks. It is highly likely that, in July 2024, the GRU attempted to
                target cargo planes by implanting a magnesium-based flammable substance in electric massagers.
                <br><br>
                These devices exploded at DHL logistics hubs in Germany, Poland and the UK and were test runs for
                potential future attacks against cargo aircraft.46 About 40 arson plots have been linked to Russia in
                Germany and Poland, including the destruction of the Warsaw shopping centre.
              </div>

              Imagine going about your day and your local mall just burns down due to foreign sabotage.

              <br><br>

              Last point, but the summary of policy advancements and insights at the end felt lackluster.

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block"> European strategic culture further constrains effective deterrence. Western
                democratic legal systems and values impose limitations that authoritarian adversaries exploit externally
                and can ignore at home
              </div>

              Thanks, I never knew that! The examples that accompanied this point were good, and I think my main gripe
              anyway is that I just don’t understand how to control all the little buttons and dials that go along with
              national security policy. At the end of the day, who has discretion? What power do national security
              agencies really have? This excerpt from the last paragraph makes me feel a bit more confident in thinking
              that the agencies themselves aren’t quite sure about the optimal policy either.

              <br><br>
              <div class="quote-block"> The response by NATO and EU has been to define Russia’s unconventional war as
                operations in the grey zone, below the threshold of conventional war. However, the grey zone concept,
                while descriptive of hostile activity below the threshold of direct state-on-state conflict, has
                outlived
                its utility: it now too often serves as a bureaucratic shield, allowing governments to avoid decisive
                action and responsibility. As military historian Hew Strachan has noted, a critical shortfall in Western
                security thinking lies in a lack of clarity on what constitutes war, creating dangerous confusion
              </div>

              <h2> Chinese Peptides</h2>
              I feel like I’ve been hearing about these things since late November, but they seem to have been a thing
              starting a bit earlier this year according to this <a
                href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/09/14/everyone-has-chinese-peptide-dealer-now/"> SF Standard
                article</a>.

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block">
                Ji, a retired poker pro who dabbles in crypto, began microdosing retatrutide in February. Within days,
                she said, her “food noise” faded, her portions shrank, and her weight dropped from 135 to 115 pounds. “I
                am exactly vain enough to inject myself to look thinner,” she said. “I played poker for a career, so
                taking risks doesn’t bother me.”

                <br><br>

                Ji’s stash didn’t come from a pharmacy but from a Chinese peptide dealer she’d been connected to on
                WhatsApp by tech friends. She paid the guy $195 for 10 vials. “Three weeks later, it shows up at your
                door,” she said.

              </div>


              I’m not too sure I have many thoughts on this. These are the first couple of questions/answers that come
              up though.

              <br><br>

              Is the consumer basis somehow different since they’re from SF? Probably, but in the sense that they’re
              more open to injecting Chinese peptides in the first place. I would assume that a percentage of consumers
              are vain/insecure and that can be attributed to the startup-AI-industrial complex that has a lot of
              cultural sway among younger tech workers, but, again, there are huge benefits with seemingly low costs.

              <h2> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24886484/"> Mathematical modeling in biology</a></h2>

              I thought I would have a lot more to say about this essay, but I can barely understand biology! Here’s my
              favorite excerpt of the pages I did understand.

              <div class="quote-block">
                Black used mathematical models on the road that led to the first beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists,
                or beta blockers, and in his lecture for the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine he crystallized
                his understanding of them in a way that nobody has ever bettered:

                <br><br>

                ‘Models in analytical pharmacology are not meant to be descriptions, pathetic descriptions, of nature;
                they are designed to be accurate descriptions of our pathetic thinking about nature’.

                <br><br>

                Just substitute ‘systems biology’ for ‘analytical pharmacology’ and you have it. Black went on to say
                about models that: ‘They are meant to expose assumptions, define expectations and help us to devise new
                tests’.

                Better yet, I gained from Ilana’s choice some unexpected leverage. By revealing her ploy to all her many
                friends in this article, I am, years later, teaching her a lesson I once feared she might never learn:
                Revenge is a dish best served cold.

              </div>

              This is a pretty fun tradition and I would like to do this with my friends! I think that a lot of insights
              regarding child rearing can probably be applied to the maintenance of friendships.

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block">

                I chose to maintain the tradition because I’d come to appreciate Mark Twain’s aphorism: “When I was a
                boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to
                be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.” While raising our own kids,
                Amy and I saw our parents’ wisdom crystallized. Rather than trying never to repeat their mistakes, we
                worked to emulate the madness of their methods.
              </div>

              Here are the other cute traditions the Emanuel family have.

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block"> If you want to raise successful children, families have to eat together. No
                matter my job, Amy and I made it a practice to carve out at least four evenings a week for dinner.
                Knowing that Shabbat dinners often run long, President Obama would sometimes text me late on Friday
                nights: “Is it safe to call yet?”

                <br><br>

                During my childhood, my mother insisted that our family convene at a circular table without a head so
                that everyone would feel an equal right to speak and be heard… But my parents believed that open debate
                was the best way for us to learn and gain confidence. Amy and I continued that tradition with one
                update: We banished screens from the table. The point was to interact, even if you were too young to
                talk, or too much of a teenager to care what your moron parents had to say. The meals paid a dividend.
              </div>


              This is something that I can’t quite fathom the positive effects of since my family’s never done this and
              I’ve never been in the mood to “debate” my parents/sibling on anything since I just think they’re really
              stupid. I do this a lot with my friends and I wish to do it more: enjoying a meal while having a
              stimulating debate.


              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block">
                Rather than broadcasting our kids’ report cards, Amy and I established a different tradition. A child
                who did something particularly noteworthy in school any given week earned the privilege of eating off
                the “star plate” on Shabbat and was offered the opportunity to invite a friend’s family for dinner. This
                was considered an honor, but Amy and I had an additional motive: We believed we would glean more from
                observing the friends they selected than we would from scouring their backpacks.
              </div>

              This is probably the most interesting thing I’ve ever heard in regards to report cards, but it’s pretty
              simplistic and appeals to my microecon-pilled brain. Emanuel is using that choice of friend as a way to
              gather more information about his son’s revealed preference for his set of preferred personalities. Since
              that choice is made somewhat freely (and probably without too much strategic thinking on the son’s part),
              this is an incentive compatible way to reveal a part of his son’s life and values without doing much work.

              From <a
                href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/top-heritage-officials-flee-to-mike-pences-nonprofit-as-think-tank-fractures-28765f2b">
                Top Heritage Officials Flee to Mike Pence’s Nonprofit as Think Tank Fractures:</a>
              <br><br>
              <div class="quote-block">
                In an interview, Pence told the Journal he had long admired the Heritage Foundation but sees the group
                now “abandoning its principles.” He said the foundation had “fallen” because it had embraced elements of
                isolationism, stopped backing Ukraine in the war with Russia, supported some tariffs and backed Robert
                F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary, among other things.

                <br><br>

                “Why these people are coming our way is that Heritage and some other voices and commentators have
                embraced big-government populism and have been willing to tolerate antisemitism,” Pence said.

                <br><br>

                Among those joining AAF are John Malcolm, the head of the foundation’s legal and judicial studies
                center, Kevin Dayaratna, the head of the foundation’s data analysis center and Richard Stern, the
                director of the foundation’s economic policy studies institute. AAF said it is bringing on about a dozen
                other staff members. Malcolm is taking seven members of his center’s team.

              </div>

              This seems like a huge knockout to the Heritage Foundation. From my understanding, this can be taken as an
              example of elite conservative (libertarian economics views, but conservative social ones) breaking away
              from the national conservatives of the movement. More specifically, this is due to the president <a
                href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heritage-foundation-kevin-roberts-tucker-carlson-interview-nick-fuentes/">
                Kevin
                Roberts putting out a video defending Carlson from criticism of his interview with Nick Fuentes.
              </a>

              <br><br>

              On the donor front, it seems like they’re moving away from Heritage in favor of AAF (Advancing American
              Freedom).

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block"> Art Pope, a longtime prominent donor in North Carolina, said he had stopped
                giving to the Heritage Foundation because he saw the group supporting populist economic policies in
                recent years. He is now giving to AAF, he said, in a bid to move the party in a different direction.

                <br><br>

                “President Trump’s term is coming to an end. The Republican Party is not going to see really a primary
                among candidates but a primary on principles and fundamental policies,” he said.
              </div>

              The following quote is from Tim Chapman who’s the leader of AAF and also a former Heritage Chief of Staff.

              <div class="quote-block">
                “It was a moment of opportunity we didn’t necessarily see coming three months ago. It supercharges our
                capacity on a whole number of fronts,” Chapman said.

                <br><br>

                AAF said it was able to raise more than $10 million in a few weeks to make the new hires

              </div>


              That’s great! The rest of the article is to stifle anyone’s hopes of this meaning that a more
              elite/correct/moral conservative movement will arise from the ashes of Heritage. They’re still big and the
              establishment very much favors National Conservatism. It’s good that traditional conservatives are
              fighting back and that they still have a nontrivial donor base.

              <br><br>

              Oh shoot, I almost forgot to mention this, but here’s a <a
                href="https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/21/my-resignation-from-the-heritage-foundation/"> letter </a>
              from Josh Blackman (who resigned from the
              Heritage Foundation) making it explicit that this divide is due to rightist antisemitism.

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block">
                Yet, Heritage came to a crashing halt after your infamous video. Your initial remarks were indefensible.
                Your apology was underwhelming. And the lack of any meaningful followup over the past three months has
                been telling. For reasons only you know, you aligned the Heritage Foundation with the rising tide of
                antisemitism on the right.

                <br><br>
                As Senator Ted Cruz <a

                  observed </a>, "this poison of antisemitism on the right . . . is spreading with young
                people."

                <br><br>

                I agree with <a
                  href="https://www.jns.org/ben-shapiro-urges-heritage-foundation-to-break-with-tucker-carlson/"> Ben
                  Shapiro </a>: "If the Heritage Foundation wishes to retain its status as a leading thought
                institution in the conservative movement, it must act as ideological border control." Antisemitism is
                always the canary in the coalmine. History teaches us that any society that fails to protect its Jewish
                people is destined for despair.

              This letter is great, but what’s fucking hilarious about is that someone griefed one of the links (the one
              hyperlinked with “rising tide of antisemitism on the right”) to a now deleted google doc (here’s a <a

                  Warren Buffet is sort of cool!</a>
              </h2>
              <time> Dec 24, 2025</time>

              This was a really refreshing article to read. It was written by Seth Klarman, another value-investor, and
              it’s a piece about Warren Buffet’s retirement and his life.
              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block"> Buffett’s imminent retirement at the age of 95 is a moment to reflect on the
                qualities that have made him the most successful investor of all time. These qualities—relentless
                curiosity, analytical consistency, focused effort, and humility, along with high integrity, a
                personality unchanged by wealth or success, and a sunny optimism about the United States—have made him
                an American role model. He has also epitomized respect for old-fashioned American values—free markets, a
                democratic system of governance, patriotism, and plain old common sense—that today have lost some of
                their currency. Now, in a world alarmingly short of proper role models, Buffett is departing the scene.
                His voice and example will be deeply missed.
              </div>



              Throughout reading this article, I noticed myself taking in every virtue associated with Buffet and
              connected it with other things that I’ve heard in academia and other parts of life as well. I find it so
              interesting that all of the virtues/rules that people profess as moral are invariant under any change in
              setting or context. Integrity, humility, curiosity, and a hardworking nature are virtues that everyone,
              regardless of professional background or culture, generally tend to admire and seek out in themselves and
              others.

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block"> 1. An alert, quick, accurate, and decisive mind that gives him the ability to
                form reliable investment judgments.

                <br><br>

                2. Simplicity of thought, getting right to the heart of the matter in analyzing each investment.

                <br><br>

                3. The ability to distinguish good investments from bad ones, and great investments from merely good
                ones—and the insight and conviction to stick with the best ones over time. Buffett, to paraphrase the
                investment guru Peter Lynch, never cut his flowers or watered his weeds.

                <br><br>

                4. The ability to stay focused over long periods and avoid distraction.

                <br><br>

                5. The mental agility to alter his strategy when he found a way to improve, such as when he came to more
                significantly emphasize the quality of a business in his decision making.
              </div>



              When I was reading over these 5 points, I was reminded of the virtues usually valued in an academic
              setting. (1) is the equivalent of a mathematician having an ability to think quickly about a new problem
              and providing a profound insight. I feel like every academic has some story of another (usually an older)
              academic being able to instantly solve a confusing problem they presented to them.

              <br><br>

              Simplicity is also highly valued in, at the very least, non-hard STEM fields e.g mathematics, computer
              science, etc. Being able to get to the heart of a proof or theorem is a sign of a high mathematical
              maturity and (2) is valuing just that, but in a completely different setting.

              <br><br>

              Point (3) feels more easily applicable to fields that are under the umbrella of applied math. This sort of
              thinking is highly-valued in economics. Being able to see through the data, synthesize it with theory, and
              all in service to make a profoundly new insight into the world is hard and very few people in this world
              can do that consistently at a high level of quality.

              <br><br>

              (4) and (5) are, again, common virtues within academia that point to an academic’s quality.

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block"> Buffett acknowledged his new insight this way: “I try to invest in businesses
                that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them. Because sooner or later, one will.”
              </div>



              This excerpt reminds me of <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-04-02-0199">
                Federalist 51 </a> and a very famous excerpt from it: “If men were angels, no
              government would be necessary.” Systems and management of systems can make or break an entire operation.

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block"> Buffett’s enduring popularity, at least in part, is due to his enduring
                humility, sense of perspective, genuine wonder, and perpetual gratitude for how his life has turned out.
              </div>

              I recently told a friend that I’ve become much less of a utilitarian in the past year. I don’t have any
              rigorous philosophical arguments and the best justification I have for buying more into virtue ethics is
              due to Friedman’s “rules vs discretion” dictum applied to ethics. However, another justification (that
              isn’t really valid) is by observing other individuals that are described as moral or highly successful
              having the same virtues and personality characteristics ascribed to them: curiosity, humility, desire for
              human connection, high work-ethic, and a steady temper.

              To clarify, this is the share of people who make an income and so children, the elderly, and disabled
              aren't included in the above.

              <br><br>

              This is also from the author of the article, which summarizes some of the data, which is from the
              <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html"> five-year American Community
                Survey </a> for 2023.

              <br><br>

              <div class="quote-block"> Percentages are out of workers who reported salary income greater than zero. So
                you see all the jobs when the threshold is set to $0. Increase the threshold, and, as expected, the
                percentage of people who make more decreases. Administrative support and sales grow less common as
                management and healthcare practitioners become more common with higher income.

                <br><br>

                At $45,000 per year, half of workers make more. The share of workers who make more decreases quicker
                with higher thresholds. At $100,000, only 16% of workers make more. 4% of workers make more than
                $200,000.

                <br><br>

                The final 1% makes more than $520,000. While the categories — management, healthcare practitioners, and
                sales — seem about right, I am curious about the less typical jobs, such as cashiers and elementary
                school teachers who reported making more than half a million in salary. I suspect these are directors
                and managers who do more than manage. Or it could just be noise. I’m betting the former.

              </h2>

              <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Spring_Harbor_Laboratory"> Cold Spring Harbor
                  Laboratory
                </a> created an obituary for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watson"> James Watson</a> who
                died a month ago (November
                5th). I’ve never heard of CSHL before, but apparently they’re a big deal.

                Anyway, Pachter just dunks on Watson with his comments (in red) and here are some excerpts of his
                commentary.</p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p> Watson, along with Crick and Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
                  Watson also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Gerald Ford and the National
                  Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton, among many other awards and prizes.</p>
                <p style="color: red"> It is true that Watson received these awards. Coincidentally, William Shockley
                  was also awarded the Nobel Prize around the same time as Watson (physics, 1956) and he promoted racist
                  eugenics, arguing that people of African Ancestry posed a “dysgenic risk”, as well as advocating for
                  sterilization. He used his Nobel prestige to advance his malicious and scientifically bankrupt ideas
                  (source: Scott Rosenberg, 2017)</p>

              </div>

              <p> He portrays Watson as not as intelligent as his awards make him out to be, a dick, and a race realist.
                Ronald Fischer was sort of a race realist and a dick, but a genius within statistics. Watson, from my
                limited understanding of him, seems to be like Ronald Fischer, but just worse in every way. He also just
                seemed to be particularly petty especially against other women within biology e.g Rosalind Franklin.
              </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p>As an author, Watson wrote two books at Harvard that were and remain best sellers. The textbook
                  Molecular Biology of the Gene, published in 1965 (7th edition, 2020), changed the nature of science
                  textbooks, and its style was widely emulated. </p>
                <p style="color: red"> In this textbook Watson got the central dogma wrong, presenting it in a
                  profoundly misleading way. (source: Matthew Cobb, 2024).</p>
              </div>
              The <a href="https://www.asimov.press/p/crick"> article Pachter cites </a> is really well written! Reading
              it was fun and I learned a little bit of biology
              that might just stick. Anyway, Cobb states that Watson misinterpreted Crick’s idea (“the central dogma”).
              That original idea was that the usual chain one sees in biology, DNA -> RNA -> Proteins, can’t be observed
              strictly in reverse. However, Crick doesn’t discard the fact that, for example, DNA can’t be replicated
              from RNA. Indeed, this was in fact shown in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/2261198a0">
                lab</a>.
              <div class="quote-block">
                <p> But on pages 1209 and 1211 of this issue of Nature, Baltimore and Mizutani and Temin claim
                  independently that RNA tumour viruses contain an enzyme which uses the viral RNA as a template for the
                  synthesis of DNA and thus reverses the direction of genetic transcription.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p> Now, I’m not too sure of Pachterß's point. I can’t find a copy of the original 1965 book since later
                editions have presumably been updated accordingly. However, I did easily find a copy of the seventh
                edition, which ßcontains theß following sentence on page 41. </p>
              <div class="quote-block">
                As we have seen, according to the “central dogma” information flows from DNA to
                RNA to protein.
              </div>

              <p> This sentence is out of context since this is what was written on page 33. </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p> In 1956 Francis Crick referred to this pathway for the flow of genetic information as the central
                  dogma: </p>
                <img src="./pics/mollecular_bio_diagram.png" alt="" width="700" height="100" />
                <p> The arrow between DNA and RNA indicates that RNA synthesis (called transcription) is directed by a
                  DNA template. Corre- spondingly, the synthesis of proteins (called translation) is directed by an RNA
                  template. Most importantly, the last two arrows were presented as uni- directional; that is, RNA
                  sequences are never determined by protein tem- plates nor was DNA then imagined ever to be made on RNA
                  templates.

                  <br><br>

                  However, as we will see in Chapter 12, RNA chains sometimes do act as templates for DNA chains of
                  complementary sequence. Such reversals of the normal flow of information are very rare events compared
                  with the enormous number of RNA molecules made on DNA templates.
                </p>
              </div>


              <p> I think the authors of the seventh edition essentially pulled that diagram from <a
                  href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/xmscu3g4/items"> Crick’s original
                  thought process </a> (found through Cobb’s article), which is pretty interesting.
                <br>
                <img style="float:auto" src="./pics/crick_central_dogma.png" alt="" width="600" height="500" />
              </p>

              <p> From everything I’ve read so far, it seems like a lot of people misinterpreted what Crick’s intentions
                were, so I don’t think this is that big of a deal. It seems like the book has had a net-positive impact
                on people and especially due to all of the lovely people who continually created newer and better
                editions of it.
              </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p> The Double Helix (1968) was a sensation at the time of publication. Watson’s
                  account of the events that resulted in the elucidation of the structure of DNA remains controversial,
                  but still widely read.</p>

                <p style="color:red"> Prior to the publication of The Double Helix, Francis Crick wrote that “If you
                  publish your book now, in
                  the teeth of my opposition, history will condemn you”. Watson published the book anyway (source:
                  letter
                  by Francis Crick, 1967) .</p>


              </div>

              <p> This is another point, which, on the surface, seems like a straightforward dunk, but actually has a
                much more interesting story. The point Pachter is implicitly making is completely true: Watson’s
                account of the discovery of the structure of DNA in the original 1968 autobiography and Crick very
                much condemned him at the time. The Double Helix is quite inaccurate and is a very personal account of
                every event and of other people’s involvement.

                <br><br>

                The canonical example everyone refers to is Rosalind Franklin who is consistently referred to as
                <a href="https://dnalc.cshl.edu/view/15692-Rosalind-Franklin.html"> “Rosy” </a>. There were tensions
                between her and Maurice Wilkins (another person who shared the Nobel with
                Watson & Crick), but Watson describes Rosalind as being too assertive as a woman and blames her lack
                of femininity for the issues between her and Wilkins.

                <br><br>

                The following excerpt is from page 13 of Gunther Sten’s 1980 Norton Critical Edition of The Double
                Helix, which, alongside the original book, contains a lot of material that contrasts with Watson’s
                view.
              </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                I suspect that in the beginning Maurice hoped that Rosy would calm down. Yet mere inspection suggested
                that she would not easily bend. By choice she did not emphasize her feminine qualities. Though her
                features were strong, she was not unattractive and might have been quite stunning had she taken even a
                mild interest in clothes.

                <br><br>

                [...]

                <br><br>

                There was never lipstick to contrast with her straight black hair, while at the age of thirty-one her
                dresses showed all the imagination of English blue-stocking adolescents.

                <br><br>

                So it was quite easy to imagine her the product of an unsatisfied mother who unduly stressed the
                desirability of professional careers that could save bright girls from marriages to dull men. But this
                was not the case.

              </div>

              To end this off, here’s another Pachter post about things Watson has said. In particular:
              <br> <br>
              <div class="quote-block">
                “[Rosalind Franklin] was a loser”
              </div>

              I was going to read more about Ronald Fischer’s life since I have a strong feeling that there’s something
              to learn from comparing him and Watson, but I’ll save that for another day.

                Here’s a problem that Berkeleyside wrestles with frequently. Should we refer to residents of Berkeley as
                Berkeleyites or Berkeleyans?

                To my ear, Berkeleyites sounds better. It gets 25,000 results on Google. Someone has entered it into the
                City Dictionary. Berkeleyan, on the other hand, gets 110,000 Google hits. Looks like a done deal,
                doesn’t it? But hang on. A lot of those Berkeleyan hits are because it’s the accepted adjective for
                things relating to Bishop Berkeley (photo left) or his system of philosophical idealism.

                Tell us readers. What do you think? Of course, we could cut the Gordian knot and just agree to call
                everyone Berkeleysiders.

              </div>

              I think Berkeleyan makes the most sense here since due to Bishop Berkeley’s idea of <a
                href="https://academic.oup.com/book/2713/chapter-abstract/143184609?redirectedFrom=fulltext"> Berkeleyan
                Idealism</a>,
              Another spelling seems to be with an “i” and thus <a
                href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Berkeleian"> Berkelian </a>, which feels a bit cooler.
              I get the same
              vibes from “Bayesian” as “Berkelyan”.

              <br><br>

              Oddly enough, Urban Dictionary only has a record from 2011 of Berkeleyite (Berkeleyside article was
              published April 2011). “Berkelyite” is pretty lame, but “Berkelite” looks/sounds a bit better.

                The biggest shift I felt right away was the sudden, exponential spike in imposter syndrome. UW did
                something clever during orientation for the first-year PhD cohort: the very first slide they showed
                simply read “YOU BELONG HERE.” All caps.
              </div>

              Shachar Kariv (economist at Berkeley), during the first lecture of his economic theory class, constantly
              reminded the graduate students of this fact. I internally scoffed (since I was/am a “smart”
              undergraduate) at first, and all the other times he would find little ways to remind his audience they
              were enough.

              <br />
              <br />

              Anyway, right before our midterm and right after, he emphasized this to each and every person in that
              class and I’m glad he did. I didn’t score as well as I had wanted (earned a B), but his reassurance that
              we all deserved to be there did put a smile on my face when we received our grades for that midterm a
              week later.
              <br /><br />
              <div class="quote-block">
                What struck me was how my mind reacted to all of this. You’d think I would remind myself, “Hey, I
                started a PhD with twelve publications, which is a wild number for an undergrad.” But no. Instead, the
                thought that greeted me on day one was:

                <br /><br />

                “Alright. You’ve managed to weasel your way through so far. Now’s the moment they finally uncover that
                you’re a fraud.”
              </div>

              This weirdly reminds me of the pledge that fellows of the

                truth which from the separate approaches every true scholar is striving to descry.

              Taking extreme pride in all of your work is almost the definition of hubris. Taking too little is a
              toxic humility.

                The point is this: I don’t think anyone is fully aware of the complexity of who they are until they’re
                pushed to face themselves. A high-pressure environment forces those parts to the surface — all of them
                — and you finally see what’s been hiding underneath.
              </div>

              This is a really good takeaway.

              <p>
                This article is from the International Center for Law & Economics and I don't really pay attention to
                antitrust stuff, but this article seemed pretty interesting. The subject of the article is the
                European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA, 2023), which forces "gatekeepers"-think Apple and Google-to
                allow for alternative in-app payment processing and app stores on their mobile operating systems.
                Here's an

                  article
                </a>
                with some examples of alternative app stores that are allowed in the EU <br /><br />
              </p>

                The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and similar regulations around the world require designated
                “gatekeepers” to open their mobile operating systems to third-party app stores and sideloading. They
                also typically include requirements that developers be allowed to use alternative in-app payment
                systems and to “steer” users toward purchases outside the app store.
              </div>

              The thesis of the article is that one can't maximize both competition among third-party app stores and
              payment processors. Since all of these app stores would have to draw their revenue from somewhere and
              would be forced to follow Apple's example of charging a commission on in-app sales and banning apps that
              didn't comply. A good example of this is Apple banning
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1knw4jq/fortnite_removed_from_app_store_entirely_after/">
                Fortnite
              </a>
              for bypassing their 30% commission on in-app purchases. <br /><br />
              Now, if one forces app stores to allow developers to contract alternative payment processors (think
              PayPal or Venmo) then developers would be able to keep more of their revenue and free ride off of the
              investments of all of those alternative app stores. Additionally, these alternative app stores would
              themselves be relying on OS-level infrastructure (discovery, security, etc.) and be free riding off of
              Apple's investments. This would lead to underinvestment in what makes the Apple app store work
              reasonably well in the first place e.g fraud protection, curation, advertising, etc.
              <br /><br />

                </p>
                Alternative payments and steering compound the problem. Developers can use the store’s discovery and
                curation infrastructure to acquire users, then route purchases through lower-cost payment channels.
                The store still bears the cost of matching users and developers but loses the revenue that justified
                that investment.
              </div>

              Or, it would lead to Apple increasing costs for developers!

                Developers operating under the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU have the option to
                distribute their iOS and iPadOS apps in the EU via the App Store, Web Distribution, and/or alternative
                app marketplaces. They can also use alternative payment processors in their apps in the EU on the App
                Store across Apple operating systems. The CTF only applies to apps downloaded by EU users on devices
                running minimum of iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 18.

                Fee for each first annual install over one million. Developers pay a CTF of €0.50 for each first
                annual install over one million in the past 12 months.
              </div>
              I feel convinced that the DMA doesn't make too much sense, since it really just makes it harder for
              companies to provide/maintain the infrastructure needed for app developers to flourish.

                Not completely sure where I found out about this article. It probably was from Marginal Revolution.
                Regardless, here's an excerpt that gave me a bit more insight on the art of game theoretic modeling.

                <p class="source">Source: Journal of Economic Literature, Roger Myerson</p>
                One of the triumphs of Fearon’s approach is his demonstration that a preventive war by a currently
                dominant nation against a rising nation, such as Germany contemplated against Russia in 1914, can be
                understood in terms of moral-hazard commitment problems in a dynamic game.
                <br />
                <br />
                [...] <br />
                <br />
                The key to this analysis is that the rising nation cannot credibly commit itself now to refrain from
                using its ability to threaten war in the future after power has shifted in its favor, but the
                currently dominant nation could prevent this shift of power by launching a costly war now.
                <br /><br />
              </div>
              If I'm being honest, this doesn't offer too much insight into the Great war as it is by itself. The
              excerpt is just a good example of game theory and its language being used to convey one plausible
              explanation for conflict. Myerson does of course mention this a bit later.

                As Wolford rightly argues, we can gain important insights into the problems of war when we try to
                explain leaders’ choices as rational decisions in terms of natural human values. But what would happen
                if we tried to rationalize a surprising decision that was actually a mistake? The surprising move
                could be rationalized in a Bayesian game by hypothesizing that the decision maker has an unusual type
                with preferences or beliefs that would induce such behavior
                <br />
                <br />
                [...]
                <br /><br />
                Thus, Germany’s surprising invasion of Belgium in 1914 could cause people in Britain to infer that
                Germany had aggressive expansionist leadership, while people in Germany might consider such beliefs to
                be unjustified British prejudice.

              I'm not super sure, but the issue of decision-making under a misspecified model is, at least
              theoretically, explored in the paper

                When walking outside I sometimes get a sense of appreciation for how paradise-like my surroundings

                I walk to the park near my home. A park! How absurdly utopian it is that we’ve fenced off an area
                that’s sole purpose is just to be nice. In the park there are pigeons waddling around fat on French
                fries, because food is so abundant that people are sometimes careless with it. (And French fries
                exist! Transcendent deliciousness beyond a cave man’s wildest dreams.)

                “I think that’s very much the ethos now: Everybody has to do their part to save Cal football,” Kranz
                said. “We have to turn to communism to save Cal football, not out of ideology, but out of desperation.
                A lot of this effort is about trying to preserve something that is a unifying sense of community for
